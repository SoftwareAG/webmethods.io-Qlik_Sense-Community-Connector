## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
This connector requires any [Node](https://nodejs.org/dist/) version between 8.14.0 and 10.14.2.

Note: If you have installed any other Node version on your system, you can:
1. Use tools to switch between different versions of Node

  - For Windows, use [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#installation--upgrades).
  
  - For Mac, use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
2. Build your app using your existing Node version and then transpile your code using a transpiler like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

The connector has been built with [wmiocli](https://docs.webmethods.io/integration/developer_guide/connector_builder/#gsc.tab=0), webmethod.io's iPaaS Connector Builder CLI tool, which must be installed. 

### Getting the API key
API requests are made via HTTPS using the {your-tenant-name}.ap.qlikcloud.com subdomain. Each request must be authenticated with a user's Bearer token containing a valid API key. As this connector is a one-off integration for internal use, we can generate an API key directly from our Qlik Sense account. You can create these from the My Account > Settings > API Keys page in your Qlik Sense account:

Note: Ensure you have 'Developer' as a role to be able to generate new API keys. To add 'Developer' to your roles, go to My Account > Administration > Users > Edit Roles > Select 'Developer'.

### Installing

3. Login to your webmethods.io tenant using `wmio login`.
4. Execute `wmio init` to get started.
5. Finally, execute `wmio deploy` to deploy this connector to your tenant.

Once deployed, itâ€™ll be automatically registered with webMethods.io Integration and will be available to you locally in the Connectors panel under the Services tab.

## Running the tests
To test, you can execute `wmio test`.

## Deployment
Execute `wmio deploy` to deploy this connector to your webmethods.io tenant. And `wmio unpublish` to unpublish the published connector app along with triggers and actions associated with the app.
