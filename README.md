This is a Webmethods.io community connector for [Qlik Sense](https://www.qlik.com/us/trial/qlik-sense-business), a self-service data discovery and analysis tool which focuses on ease of use for the user.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
This connector requires any [Node](https://nodejs.org/dist/) version between 8.14.0 and 10.14.2.

Note: If you have installed any other Node version on your system, you can:
1. Use tools to switch between different versions of Node

  - For Windows, use [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#installation--upgrades).
  
  - For Mac, use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
2. Build your app using your existing Node version and then transpile your code using a transpiler like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

The connector has been built with [wmiocli](https://docs.webmethods.io/integration/developer_guide/connector_builder/#gsc.tab=0), webmethod.io's iPaaS Connector Builder CLI tool, which must be installed. 

### [Getting the API key](https://developer.capsulecrm.com/v2/overview/authentication)
API requests are made via HTTPS using the api.capsulecrm.com subdomain. Each request must be authenticated with a user's Bearer token. As If this connector is a one-off integration for internal use, we can generate a token directly from our Capsule account. You can create these from the My Preferences > API Authentication Tokens page in your Capsule account:
